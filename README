OCaml Bytecode Cleaner.

See the OCaPIC project (http://www.algo-prog.info/ocapic/web/index.php?id=ocapic) for more informations.

## Word of warning

I have simply told the cleaner to accept 4.12.0 OCaml bytecode. I ran into an issue with the environment cleaning step, and so I removed it.
While it successfully outputs a (much smaller!) bytecode file, I can provide **no guarantees** that it works as intended!
I don't know the changes between the format of V023 and V029 bytecode (there is zero documentation), so while it seemingly works it may actually break the code.
Be warned!
